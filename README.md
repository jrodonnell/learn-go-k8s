# code-boneyard

Snippets and things that are interesting or useful in principle but not necessarily in practice, at least for me and specifically what I'm working on currently. Nevertheless, there could be things in here that might be useful in the future, so I'm storing them here. Most of these things are snippets that I developed in the process of working on something and either realized that's not what I needed or the scope of the work changed and this code became OBE. Can potentially raid for parts later!
